hexOS scans through the description of the mission.

It will scan for the following pattern, which can exist anywhere in the description: 

[hexOS] #,#,#,#,#,#,#,#
where # is a number.

Each # represents a specific mod setting.



1st #: Custom Solve Quote (string, default " ")

2nd #: Amount of delay in seconds between each beta (0-1 including decimals, default 0.07)
This number gets increased by 0.05 every strike.

3rd #: Can be octOS (0-1, default 1)

4th #: Must be octOS (0-1, default 0)

5th #: Fast Strike (0-1, default 0)
When enabled, octOS will use a shorter strike animation.

6th #: Experimental Shake (0-1, default 0)
Accessibility feature for deaf people where the module shakes subtly on every beat.
Possibly distracting for other people.

7th #: Force Alt Solve (0-1, default 0)
Forces the toilet to show up, as well as a different theme for solving the module in hexOS.

8th #: Flash Other Colors (0-6, default 5)
The amount of times other colors flash. The higher, the harder.
This number gets decreased by 1 every strike.
