Phosphorescence scans through the description of the mission.

It will scan for the following pattern, which can exist anywhere in the description: 

[Phosphorescence] #,#,#,#,#,#,#,#
where # is a number.

Each # represents a specific mod setting.



1st #: Cruel Mode (0-1, default 0)
Makes colored buttons not have labels.

2nd #: Stream delay (any integer, default 0)
Increases or decreases time, by increments of 15. Fixed constant.
