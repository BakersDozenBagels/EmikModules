The Octadecayotton scans through the description of the mission.

It will scan for the following pattern, which can exist anywhere in the description: 

[The Octadecayotton] #,#,#,#,#,#,#
where # is a number.

Each # represents a specific mod setting.



1st #: Number of Dimensions (3-12, default 9)

2nd #: Number of Rotations (0-255, default 3)

3rd #: The Slowness of Spheres (1-12, default 8)
The higher, the slower.
Each +/-1 will multiply or divide the speed by 2, respectively.

4th #: Color Assist (0-1, default: 0)
If 0, the colors will always update based on local position.
If 1, the colors will be maintained for each sphere.

5th #: InOutBounce (0-1, default: 0)
If 0, nothing happens.
If 1, the spheres will move using the InOutBounce ease. https://easings.net/#easeInOutBounce
By default InOutCubic is used. https://easings.net/#easeInOutCubic

6th #: InOutElastic (0-1, default: 0)
If 0, nothing happens.
If 1, the spheres will move using the InOutElastic ease. https://easings.net/#easeInOutElastic
By default InOutCubic is used. https://easings.net/#easeInOutCubic

7th #: Stretch to Fit (0-1, default: 0)
If 0, nothing happens.
If 1, on dimension counts that aren't divisible by 3, the cube is distorted such that the entire shape will cover the module's entire surface area.
This will make some axes exaggurated.
